Adrian Questions
a)  Is making it display on laptops/ipads important in-terms of my portfolio.
     What is the most-likely screen size my portfolio will be viewed on.

b) Background image seems to be a problem when being displayed on mobile or 1200px width. 
   Sizing error or styling error ?
   Other Approaches instead a bg?
   How to display a different bg on each page.

c) I need help figuring out what is the best approach for making the app RWD? Should I make use the Chakra-UI RWD approach? Similar to the form page.
   Or can I mix the way I apply RWD depending on the page? The app is currently a mix when it comes to RWD implementation. Is that the correct approach?

d) Is It a better idea to move the input into the weatherUI page. TBH, I'm not happy with the styling of the input page and suggestions on giving my input page a glow up

e) Let me know if my wrappers/containers are wrong

h) Should I migrate this app over to next.js ?

i) After implementing ChakraProvider it affected all my font weights. Is it possible to use my own font-family/font weights by using the theme component.
Or do I have to change the global styles within Chakra-UI
