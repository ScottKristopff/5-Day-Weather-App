Adrian Questions
a)  Is making it display on laptops/ipads important in-terms of my portfolio.
     What is the most-likely screen size my portfolio will be viewed on.

b) Input Form Control: Don't know how to disable the button on city names or by the error validation message 
   rules

c) Background Image seems to be a problem when being displayed on mobile. 
   Sizing error or styling error ?

d) Didn't use a library for form control. I wanted to understand it first before
   Implementing a library. Let me know if the way I implemented form control is
   acceptable. 

e) Disabled the sound all together due to time constraint. Couldn't find a way
  to code a mute button using the use-sound hook.

f) Splitting WeatherUI will require me to use 2-4 different api calls. So I think
I'll have to implement redux. I think redux will be better for this project all-together but
I wanted to build something without Redux to realize why it's needed.

h) Let me know if my wrappers/containers are wrong or I if I need some of them at
